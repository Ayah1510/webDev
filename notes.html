          <P >DOM, or Document Object Model, is a tree structure with a node for each HTML element, piece of text, image, and any other object in the web page.<br>
            CSS rule set is made of 2 parts: a selector and a declaration block<br>
             CSS selector starting with a dot,means a selector that applies to the class of elements.<br>
             CSS selector starting with a #,means a selector that applies to the id of elements.<br>
             Type is the simplest kind of selector. It indicates the name of one type of HTML element (such as em or li).<br>
             Class in HTML is an attribute that groups elements together that you want to have the same style.<br>
             Id is an attribute that must be unique to a single element, used to identify it.<br>

        <h3>Variable Declaration</h3>
          There are three ways to declare a variable:
          <ul id="js">
          <li> let - It a new way to declare a variable in any scope - Global, Local, or Block. The value of this variable can be changed or reassigned anytime within its scope.
            <li> const - It is also a way to declare constants in any scope - Global, Local, or Block. Once you are assigned a value to a const variable, the value of this variable CANNOT be changed or reassigned throughout the code.
              <li> var - This is the old way of declaring variables in only two scope - Global, or Local. Variables declared with the var keyword can not have Block Scope. The value of this variable can be changed or reassigned anytime within its scope.</p>
        </ul>
