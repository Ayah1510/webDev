        <p>The word inside the symbols is a tag. <br> And the whole unit with two matching tags and some text in between is called an element.</p>
        Aah! I'm confused about <em>whitespace</em>.

          The br element is a void element—it doesn't have any contents (unlike p, which does have contents!).<br><br>
          The a element is an inline element. It doesn't create a box on the page. <br>
          Links normally have the appearance of a specially highlighted piece of text. <br>

            CSS rule set is made of 2 parts: a selector and a declaration block<br>
             CSS selector starting with a dot,means a selector that applies to the class of elements.<br>
             CSS selector starting with a #,means a selector that applies to the id of elements.<br>
             type is the simplest kind of selector. It indicates the name of one type of HTML element (such as em or li).<br>
             class in HTML is an attribute that groups elements together that you want to have the same style.<br>
             id is an attribute that must be unique to a single element, used to identify it.<br>

          <p>The width property only changes the width of the contents. The padding, border, and margin are not included in the width</p>
